Old Weirdo: So, she let you in after all. Interesting. She was debating for quite some time.
My folk call me Grey Coat. You have entered the Deep Woods. Few are allowed here, probably.

Wake: Okay, but your coat is more like a greenish brown.

Grey Coat: This is a different coat.
And you are?

Wake: Wake.

Grey Coat: Wake? Hmm... Wake. What an oddly pleasent name, probably.

Wake: Oh, hello again. (to Brussell)

Grey Coat: There you are, Brussel! You know good and well that you're not supposed to leave the Deep Woods!
It's not every day that a Spritelling befriends an outsider.
That you can even see them is a feat in itself, probably.
You're a strangely small and unwrinkled old man... Are you ill? You should tell me if you are...

Wake: What? I'm not an old man!

Grey Coat: Hmm? Brussel tells me they found you crying. Why?

Wake: No I wasn't... I... So what? It's rude to sneak up on people!
What even is that creature?

Grey Coat: Whoa there, unwrikled one!
There will be time for questions later, probably. I must hasten to my people. There is much stuff to be done.
Besides, the dark will be coming soon, and what is it that we always say about the dark? Hmmm?

Wake: Who's "we"? I just met you!

Grey Coat: Incorrect! We say: "The dark is bad! The dark is bad!"
Good, okay. Let that be your first lesson.

Wake: First lesson?

Grey Coat: Take this, it is an item most essential to the people of my order.
Behold! I give you Shiny Rock!

Wake: It's... a crystal?

Grey Coat: Hmm. I don't know. We call it Shiny Rock.
Shiny Rock will guide you, probably!

Wake: Guide me where? Wait - !

Grey Coat: Nature, Hooooo!
Take me to the - umm, the place! The uhh... Ah, folioge.
The Grove! That's it! Ha! I almost forgot what our village was colled. That would've been embarrassing.
Buh-bye!

Wake: ...I must be dreaming. Kirby's never gonna believe this.

Grey Coat: Shiny Rock! It allows communication between all wearers.

Wake: Does it always feel this weird?

Grey Coat: You will eventually become used to the side effects of the mind link, probably!
Wake, there's a fellow of mine up ahead, a member of our order. His name is Scrap Heap!

Wake: ...Scrap Heap. Your friend's name is Scrap Heap.

Grey Coat: Indeed! He will help you, probably.
And thought traversing The Undergrowth may seem daunting, the Spritelings are often keen to help!

Wake: Spritelings? You mean the little yellow guys?

Grey Coat: Quite so! They are denizens of the world, and dare I say part of the Deep Woods itself. Use them for guidance! They'll know what to do!
With your device and their aid, you should easily be able to make it to Scrap Heap... Right?

Wake: But how do I contact You on this thing?

Grey Coat: Ah, yes! Well...
I usually just picture the person in my head and then laudly SCREAM their name into the crystal. That seems to work some of the time!

Wake: ...Okay.

Grey Coat: No time to waste! Onward!

Voice: Stop right there!

Wake: Huh?

Tea Kettle Weirdo: Get away from my trove of riches!
How come you upon this hallowed meadow, oh tiny, unwrinkled old man?

Wake: I'm not an old man, I'm twelve!

Tea Kettle Weirdo: Ha! Twelve is a number! Numbers can't be people! Nice try!

Wake: I'm trying to find someone. Uhh... Scrap Heap?

Tea Kettle Weirdo: Hmm?

Wake: A man named Grey Coat gave me this crystal and these little yellow guys helped me move this big rock and...

Tea Kettle Weirdo: Crystal, you say?
So it is true then. Grey Coat said that he found a potential new recruit.

Wake: New recruit? To what?

Tea Kettle Weirdo: I am Scrap Heap! Master builder and tinkerer for the Greenshield Order of these Deep Woods.

Wake: Oh. I'm Wake. I'm something of a builder myself.

Scrap Heap: Wake, you say? That doesn't sound like it should be a name! How intriguing!

Wake: Dou you know where I can find Grey Coat?

Scrap Heap: Indeed! However...

Scrap Heap: Hmm? Yes. Yes, safe. (to Shiny Rock)
At the camp. Indeed.

Wake: Who are you talking to? Is that Grey Coat?

Scrap Heap: Brussel said that? Ha! How droll. (to Shiny Rock)
Yes, yes. Tomorrow would be best, I agree. Ta.

Srap Heap: "Ahem" Apprentice!

Wake: Apprentice?

Scrap heap: The day's light fails. We will not make it to the next camp in time. We must stay here through the night.
Rest now, if you can. I'll keep a watch most vigilant.
