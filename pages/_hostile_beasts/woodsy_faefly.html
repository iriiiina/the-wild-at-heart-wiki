title: "Woodsy Faefly"
description: The Faefly is a devious winged creature, often feeding on Spritelings that came into its line of sight. When challenged, it may use the captured Spritelings as thrown weapons to attack those in pursuit. Indeed, the Faefly is a truly formidable foe while in the air. As such, it is advisable to knock the beast to the ground as quickly as possible, which deems to stun it temporarily. Tumor has it that a certain Greenshield lost their original coat to such a creature.
