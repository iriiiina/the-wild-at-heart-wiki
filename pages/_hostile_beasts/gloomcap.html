title: "Gloomcap"
description: While it still may seem on easy foe, the Gloomcaps carry large weapons and often patrol in groups, making it possible to simply overhelm those that they come across. The primitive and highly territorial Gloomcap race comes from a mysterious area of the Deep Woods called Bogbrim where their society is based, though no Greenshield can seem to remember how to get there. The last Greenshield to interact with their species, in fact the only one that the Gloomcaps trusted, disappeared years ago after attempting to confront the heart of The Never. That the Gloomcaps have left their home and encroached into other areas of the Deep Woods is a disturbing notion and likely due to desperation. Perhaps they too are suffering from the gaining power of The Never?
