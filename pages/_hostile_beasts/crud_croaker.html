title: "Crud Croaker (Toad)"
description: The Crud Croaker is quite nearly the same creature as the Bloat Toad, only differing in a manner of toxicity. This toxic variant produces a poisonous sludge scientifically known as "Crud". This creature is best left alone if possible, as it is much more difficult to deal with than its cousin, and only a Spriteling completely immune to toxicity in all forms could effectively displatch it.
