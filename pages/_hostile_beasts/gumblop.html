title: "Gumblop"
description: <p>The invertebrate Gumblop is a highly unintelligent jelly-like creature that patrols its territory looking for sustenance such as Spritelings. The Gumblop consumes its prey by enveloping it with its body, suffocating it and gradually difesting it over a lengthy period of time. Its body is partially transparent, so its prey is visible throughout this process and one can, in theory, see its brain somewhere in its body, though no one has seemed to achieve this yet.</p>
