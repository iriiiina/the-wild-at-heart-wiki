title: "Bloopcap"
description: The Bloopcap os the amphibious cousin of the Gloomcap, often found patrolling the beaches of Crystalfall or the nearby coastal caves. The Bloopcap has the unique ability to trap Spritellings in conjured bubbles. While these bubbles seem to pop of their own accord after a time, research suggests one could pop them faster with some effort.
