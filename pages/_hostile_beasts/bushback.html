title: "Bushback (or Shelterhorn)"
description: <p>The Shelterhorn is a beetle-like creature that spends most of its days partially submerged underground, consuming any insects that may dig near it. To remain undisturbed, the Shelterhorn has evolved a patch of flora on its back to camouglage it with the appearance of a bush. Though it may seem placid, when sensing a nearby threat the Shelterhorn is a very fast and aggressive foe, attacking with the large horn on ots nose.</p><p>However, like similar creatures with bulbous protuberances on their backs, if tipped over the Shelterhorn will struggle to right itself. A local Greenshield rumor even says a Shelterhorn was once flipped by a strong gust of wind.</p>
