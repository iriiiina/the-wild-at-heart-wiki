            <h2>How To Use Shiny Rock?</h2>
            <p>Grey Coat said about using Shiny Rock: "I usually just picture the person in my head and then laudly SCREAM their name into the crystal. That seems to work some of the time!"</p>
            <p>When Wake used the Shiny Rock for the first time, he asked "Does it always feel this weird?". Grey Coat answered to this: "You will eventually become used to the side effects of the mind link, probably!"</p>
