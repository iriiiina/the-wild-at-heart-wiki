title: "Crow's Nest"
description: <p>Crow's Nest is a kind and skilled alchemist, and one who should be the first to talk to when it comes to the more... interesting... aspects of The Deep Woods. Crow's Nest runs a small shop in the Grove where one could find all manner of bits and baubles to aid in crafting. If you've got the scrap that is.</p>
