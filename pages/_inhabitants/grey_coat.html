title: "Grey Coat"
description: <p>Grey Coat is the de facto leader of the Greenshield's Willowvale Chapter after the tragiv loss of two of his superiors. Wake first meets Grey Coat as the boy enters The Deep Woods, almost as though the strange man was anticipating his arrival... Or maybe he was just looking for his friend, the Spiteling named Brussel, when the little creature found Wake just outside the boundary of The Deep Woods. Grey Coar is a talented and seemingly ancient magician whose knowledge of things arcane is vast. He has a magical wooden arm, says "probably" a lot, and yes&colon; he knows his coat isn't grey. This is a different coat.</p>
