title: "Can't Dance"
description: <p>The Female twin of Can Dance. Often proving herself to be smarter, more focused, and less annoying than her brother, this doesn't stop her from constantly bickering with her twin. Can't Dance is so named because her brother, Can Dance... can dance. And she can't.</p>
