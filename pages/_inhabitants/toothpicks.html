title: "Toothpicks"
description: <p>Toothpicks was the last Greenshield to be inducted into the Willowvale chapter, which could explain why she seems more mentally present than the others. However, how long ago that was is anyone's guess. Though she is the most recent of the Greenshields in Willowvale, the effects of The Deep Woods have still begun to take hold of her, and much of her memory is gone, including her name.</p>
