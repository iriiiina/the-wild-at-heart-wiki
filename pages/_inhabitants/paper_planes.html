title: "Paper Planes"
description: <p>Paper Planes creates magical paper planes that the Greenshields use to communicate with other chapters of their order as well as offer detailed maps of the various regions of the Deep Woods. Very little is known about Paper Planes' past, mostrly because he can't speak and doesn't offer much personal information in his limited correspondence. Grey Coat refers to him as a "new friend", indicating perhaps that Paper Planes hasn't been in these Willowvale Deep Woods for too long.</p>
