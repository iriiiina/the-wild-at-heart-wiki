title: "Scrap Heap"
description: <p>Scrap Heap is the Master Tinkerer of the Willowvale Deep Woods, though perhaps the tea kettle over his head communicated that clearly enough. Scrap Heap and Wake immediately get along due to their affinities for engineering and tinkering. A bit forgetful, Scrap Heap leaves trails of parts and junk all over the woods and informs Wake that he has a "Trove" with most of its relics missing, a collection he'd surely reward the return of.</p>
