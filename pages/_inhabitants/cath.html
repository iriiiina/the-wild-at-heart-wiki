title: "Cath"
description: <p>A mysterious being that inhabits a dark and secluded corner of The Deep Woods. Cath is a Dracoon, a race of ancient cat-like serpents from a far-away land obsessed with riches that glimmer, as it puts them into a state of trance-like bliss. Highly intelligent, loquacious, and covetous; they will talk the coin right out of your pocket, or take it from your corpse. Only two are known to remain in all the world.</p>
