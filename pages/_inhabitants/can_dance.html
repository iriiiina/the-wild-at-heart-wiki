title: "Can Dance"
description: <p>The Male twin of Can't Dance. Can Dance and his sister are recent transfers from another Deep Woods, and while their usefulness is... questionable, they often carry insight into the inner-workings of The Deep Woods, the Greenshield order and its members; much of which has been forgotten by the others. Can Dance is so named because of his ability to "dance", which is just him with his arms at his side performing a small knee-bend bounce, a maneuver apparently too complicated for his sister to mimic.</p>
