title: "Litterbox"
description: The other Greenshields seem to keep away from Litterbox because of her odor, though her feline friends don't deem to mind. Litterbox often sends get cats on fetch missions throughout the Deep Woods, all of whom are now lost. Litterbox deems frantic and a bit confused. She's convinced her missing cats are actually "At a tea party with the Queen".
