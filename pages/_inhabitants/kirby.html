title: "Kirby"
description: <p>Wake's neighbor and the one who came up with The Plan in the first place! All Wake did was draw up the sketches for the stupid tree house! As per The Plan, Kirby escaped into the woods shortly after Wake. Although Wake became lost, Kirby followed him into The Deep Woods using her expert tracking skills and when confronted she maybe totally almost killed him by scaring him off a cliff. On accident. Kirby has never known her real parents, and as with Wake, Kirby ran away to escape a troubled life.</p>
