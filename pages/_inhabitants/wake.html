title: "Wake"
description: <p>Wake is a 12 year old boy from the coastal town of Willowvale. A brilliant engineer, we join Wake as he enacts <a href="../key_items/plans.html">"The Plan"</a>; to run away from the hardships of his home life along with his trusty <a href="../key_items/gustbuster.html">Gustbuster</a> and build a treehouse in the vast wilderness behind his house. However, his "very accurate and detailed <a href="../key_items/makeshift_map.html">map</a>" soon fails and he finds himself lost in a world that he doesn't recognize, a world of magical creatures and strange people that call themselves Greenshields.</p>
