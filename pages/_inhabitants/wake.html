title: "Wake"
description: Wake is a 12 year old boy from the coastal town of Willowvale. A brilliant engineer, we join Wake as he enacts 'The Plan'; to run away from the hardships of his home life along with his trusty Gustbuster and build a treehouse in the vast wilderness behind his house. However, his 'very accurate and detailed map' soon fails and he finds himself lost in a world that he doesn't recognize, a world of magical creatures and strange people that call themselves Greenshields.
