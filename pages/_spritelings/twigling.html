title: "Twigling"
description: <p>The Twigling is a Spriteling imbued with the floral magic of the Deep Woods itself. Born from the various plants and trees within the Woods, the Twigling has a keen ability to ancourage growth in budding plants and maintain an immunity to nature-based toxins. Never the type to idle the day away, they have been observed to work much faster than the other Spriteling varieties, even at the very same task.</p><p>More curious and mischievous than its cousins, the Twigling can often be cought dismantling non-natural formations, only to then quickly reconstruct them as though it has a predilection for engineering.</p>
