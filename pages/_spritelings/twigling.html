title: "Twigling"
description: <p>The Twigling is a <a href="../pages/spritelings.html">Spriteling</a> imbued with the floral magic of the Deep Woods itself. Born from the various plants and trees within the Woods, the Twigling has a keen ability to ancourage growth in budding plants and maintain an immunity to nature-based toxins. Never the type to idle the day away, they have been observed to work much faster than the other Spriteling varieties, even at the very same task.</p><p>More curious and mischievous than its cousins, the Twigling can often be cought dismantling non-natural formations, only to then quickly reconstruct them as though it has a predilection for engineering.</p>

            <p>To get more Twiglings you have to hatch them from a Spirit Well. But first you have to get a pip of a specific twigling's type from a <a href="../flora/pip_squash.html">Pip Squash</a>. And then for every pip of a specific type you can hatch a new Twigling.</p>
