title: "Shiverling"
description: <p>The Shiverling is a Spriteling that can best be described as living ice. Immune to frost effects, the Shiverling prefers a frigid climate, and is unlikelt to be found anywhere else. While their brittle form makes them more fragile than other Spritelings, they have adapted many other techniquest for survival. The Shiverling has the ability to interact with Duplication Trees to make icy clones of itself, useful for temporarily increasing herd capacity and reaching new areas. Additionally, Shiverlings are known to create pathways of pure ice when needing to cross the waterways of the mountainous areas where they are found.</p><p>Though it is clear that the Shiverling prefers its solitude, it has often been seen to be more curious of the human and humanoid denizens of the Deep Woods than its cousins, watching from afar, following from a distance, spying their doing with inquisitiveness.</p>
