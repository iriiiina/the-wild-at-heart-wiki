title: "Shiverling"
description: <p>The Shiverling is a <a href="../pages/spritelings.html">Spriteling</a> that can best be described as living ice. Immune to frost effects, the Shiverling prefers a frigid climate, and is unlikely to be found anywhere else. While their brittle form makes them more fragile than other Spritelings, they have adapted many other techniquest for survival. The Shiverling has the ability to interact with Duplication Trees to make icy clones of itself, useful for temporarily increasing herd capacity and reaching new areas. Additionally, Shiverlings are known to create pathways of pure ice when needing to cross the waterways of the mountainous areas where they are found.</p><p>Though it is clear that the Shiverling prefers its solitude, it has often been seen to be more curious of the human and humanoid denizens of the Deep Woods than its cousins, watching from afar, following from a distance, spying their doing with inquisitiveness.</p>

            <p>To get more Shiverlings you have to hatch them from a Spirit Well. But first, you have to find them - see <a href="#location">Where Can I Find Shiverling?</a>. Then you have to get a pip of a specific shiverling's type from a <a href="../flora/pip_squash.html">Pip Squash</a>. And then for every pip of a specific type you can hatch a new Shiverling.</p>
