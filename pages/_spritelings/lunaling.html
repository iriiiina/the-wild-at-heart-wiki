title: "Lunaling"
description: <p>The Lunaling is the rarest and most mysterious form of <a href="../pages/spritelings.html">Spriteling</a> currently known. Originally thought to be Will-o'-the-wisp or Hinkypunk, its luminescent composition gives it increased strength at night, allowing Lunalings to lift objects of great weight. Immune to various forms of corruption, their affinity for lunar magic also allows them to interact with ancient Lunastones, illuminating otherwise dark areas. It has even been rumored that Lunalings can fend of Nevergazers themselves, when threatened...</p><p>Lunalings can only be summoned by a shepherd trained in these Spritelings' ancient musical rites.</p>

            <p>To get more Lunalings you have to hatch them from a Spirit Well. But first, you have to find them - see <a href="#location">Where Can I Find Lunaling?</a>. Then you have to get a pip of a specific lunaling's type from a <a href="../flora/pip_squash.html">Pip Squash</a>. And then for every pip of a specific type you can hatch a new Lunaling.</p>
