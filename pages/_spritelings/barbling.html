title: "Barbling"
description: <p>Closely related to the Twiling, the Barbling has evolved from necessity a thick outer carapace of sharp spines. When engaged in combat, the Barbling has been seen to ball-up in the air and utilize their spines for a devastating imapact. More clever Barblings have even been seen to use their barbs to weigh down objects. Not only delegated to defending themselves or challenging for territory, this maneuver can also be used to break apart crystal and ice clusters. As such, they tend to dwell in mineral-rich subterranean environments.</p><p>Similar to the Emberling, the Barbling may often struggle to fir in with its Spriteling cousins due to its prickly nature. On several occasions the Barbling has been spotted giving gifts to other Spritelings to aatempt to earn their friendship.</p>
