title: "Barbling"
description: <p>Closely related to the <a href="twigling.html">Twiling</a>, the Barbling has evolved from necessity a thick outer carapace of sharp spines. When engaged in combat, the Barbling has been seen to ball-up in the air and utilize their spines for a devastating imapact. More clever Barblings have even been seen to use their barbs to weigh down objects. Not only delegated to defending themselves or challenging for territory, this maneuver can also be used to break apart crystal and ice clusters. As such, they tend to dwell in mineral-rich subterranean environments.</p><p>Similar to the <a href="emberling.html">Emberling</a>, the Barbling may often struggle to fir in with its <a href="../pages/spritelings.html">Spriteling</a> cousins due to its prickly nature. On several occasions the Barbling has been spotted giving gifts to other Spritelings to attempt to earn their friendship.</p>

            <p>To get more Barblings you have to hatch them from a Spirit Well. But first, you have to find them - see <a href="#location">Where Can I Find Barbling?</a>. Then you have to get a pip of a specific barbling's type from a <a href="../flora/pip_squash.html">Pip Squash</a>. And then for every pip of a specific type you can hatch a new Barbling.</p>
