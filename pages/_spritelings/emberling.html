title: "Emberling"
description: <p>The Emberling is a Spriteling imbued with fire, and through its naturally-occuring combustive properties it will attack faster than other Spritelings. When cooperating in numbers, Emberlings can ignite dried and dead flora, maintaining a necessary natural balance. Additionally, the Blister Roots that litter the Deep Woods can be broken down by an Emberling, as the heat radiating from the plant has no visible effect on the Spriteling.</p><p>Though it is often viewed as the natural opposite of the Twiling, the Emberling is not maligned by its plant-based cousin and the two have occasionally been seen co-mingling.</p>
