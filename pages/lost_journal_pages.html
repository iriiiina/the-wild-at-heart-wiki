    <h2 id="entry_1">Entry #1 They Call It "Book"</h2>

    <p>The Ensorcelled Missive of the Hermetic Order of the Verdant Shield. "My Charge" as they so ceremoniously declared in Snowdonia.</p>

    <p>The memory of the other Greenshields has begun to be affected in these latest years, and when I refer to the tome with its proper (though admittedly more daedalean) name, a foggy look suddenly comes across their faces. I've decided to just tell them to refer to it as "Book", which they deem more keen to understand. The "Book" is a primer for my position as the scribe of this chapter of the Deep Woods. Filled with base knowledge of all known creatures, entities, and phenomenon magical, I will supplement my copy with entries pertaining to this chapter.</p>

    <h2 id="entry_2">Entry #2</h2>
    <p>Coming Soon</p>

    <h2 id="entry_3">Entry #3 The Deep Woods</h2>

    <p>One thing I've never understood, even when prompting the question to my betters in Snowdonia, is why the wood brings in items from the outside world. They simply... appear, in mounds and piles like trash. <a href="/inhabitants/scrap_heap.html">Scrap Heap</a> doesn't seem to mind, indeed he's made it his assignment to dissect and repurpose these... things. I do like one of his most recent finds, however, a small table that companions a black disc, that when spun produces pleasant music. This must be a new invention of the outside world, as they move on and we sit here in wraped time. I wonder how long it's been?</p>

    <h2 id="entry_4">Entry #4 the Master Of These Woods</h2>

    <p>The Green Witch is a title bestrowed upon an individual - the master of one chapter of the Deep Woods. Through a process called Anointing, the individual is given a purpose through rithual magic, and assigned as the matron or patron of a Deep Woods chapter somewhere in the world. Though it is a great honor, it comes with a dire portent. The Green Witch links their soul to the Deep Woods'd magic, forever tying them to it. After their death they ascend, becoming part of the Woods itselt, forever watching over it.</p>

    <h2 id="entry_5">Entry #5</h2>
    <p>Coming Soon</p>

    <h2 id="entry_6">Entry #6 "Tinkerer Extroardinaire"</h2>

    <p>I don't know how to communicate laughter in a journal entry other than onomatopoeia, so just know that I laugh as I write this. He... He got his head stuck! In a kettle! He dove into a pile of scrap in Wedgewood HEAD FIRST. When he emerged he's thrashing and swearing in sonsternation, then, after a few moments of struggle and with a muffled sigh, seemed to accept that it wasn't coming off. How does one even accomplish such a feat?</p>

    <h2 id="entry_7">Entry #7 The Alchemist And The Magpie</h2>

    <p>This alchemist comes from Snowdonia... Complete with a magpie, for some reason. They often speak to it, and as far as I can tell, it speaks back. No matter, they are quite talanted and keep to themselves mostly. Though, come to think of it, I've never seen them sleep, ot take off that alchemist's garb... Curious.</p>

    <h2 id="entry_8">Entry #8</h2>

    <p>Coming Soon</p>

    <h2 id="entry_9">Entry #9 The Hunter</h2>

    <p>Our most recent recruit has had the unfortunate luck of encountering a Nevergazer near the reef. She has lost an eye, but seemingly not her appetite fot the hunt; she was back seeking bounties in a matter of days. I've asked get if she'd like some company and she balked, like I knew she would. Besides <a href="/inhabitants/grey_coat.html">Grey Coat</a>, she might be the one I respect most here.</p>

    <h2 id="entry_10">Entry #10 The Man From The Sky</h2>

    <p>Some days ago a machine came careening into the woods from the sky, wailing and smoking. Ffion let him in, she says, so that we could help him. He wears the garb of what I assume is perhaps military, and has suffered on injury from the crash that has removed his ability to speak... as well as seemingly broken his memory.</p>

    <p>After the initial chock of learning everything that goes on here, the secrets we keep from his world, and after we were able to convince him to unlock the door to <a href="/inhabitants/scrap_heap.html">Scrap Heap's</a> cart where he had holed himself up... He's beginning to take to his situation kindly. The Green Witch is teaching him an old magical rite that scribes once used to communicate with the other Deep Woods across the world. We've given him a name, and when broached, he grinned and shruggedas he folded another sheet. <a href="/inhabitants/paper_planes.html">Paper Planes</a> it is.</p>

    <h2 id="entry_11">Entry #11 The Idiots From Ferncrown</h2>

    <p>These two. I'm at a loss to understand why they were assigned from Ferncrown, or why they were accepted into the order in the first place. I have little to say other than I've placed them off-site from <a href="/map/the_grove.html">The Grove</a> for several reasons thus far, on special "missions" that range from tasks such as finding twelve golden Sheltergrubs to complete a crown for The Green Witch that definitely won't be made, or going the boon of the three Dredgehogs and obtaining the teeth of the Dracoons... Things which are impossible, of course.</p>

    <p>But alas, one of them can dance. We're saved.</p>

    <h2 id="entry_12">Entry #12 My Name Is Big Pockets</h2>

    <p>I suppose, while I catalogue this chapter of the Order, I should, for posterity, describe myself. I am among those in rarified air who are not affected by the memory consumption that one undergoes after prolonged proximal exposure to <a href="/hostile_beasts/the_never.html">The Never</a>. That is to say, I remember my real name, though after a friend forgot it and gave me a new moniker, I elected to go by it. "You have quite big pockets..." he said with a quizzical look while trying to remember.</p>

    <p>I am the scribe assigned by Snowdonia to this Willowvale chapter of the Deep Woods... My responsibilities are to catalogue the events, people, and creatures of this chapter. It is my first assignment from out headquarters, one I am eager to excel at, though I must say some of my assigned compatriots might prove... tedious.</p>

    <h2 id="entry_13">Entry #13 Stick Figures</h2>

    <p>Anointed in Snowdonia; the Green Witch of this Willowvale chapter. Ffion is her name, and she is one of the few who has retained memory of it, though she chooses not to go by it. Stick Figures is her moniker based on an affinity for creating imbued wards from figures made of, well, sticks. She carves the figures using an athame, the blade of which is Gibeon, a material form beyond this world. She is kind and soft in voice and manner, though I sense a sadness in her. I think it is likely the burden she bears, a thing the rest of us know but prefer not to give words to.</p>

    <p>I am conflicted. I would like to comfort het if I could but...</p>

    <p>Why do I feel this way?</p>

    <h2 id="entry_14">Entry #14 In Pursuit Of The Traveler</h2>

    <p>Not even the Archscribes know much of The Old Wardens, but it is strongly implied that they were not human and did not come from Earth, or at least not in the plane that humans occupy.</p>

    <p>Through the ancient missives in Snowdonia, when the Order was young, one could deduce that long ago, when humanity was in its nascent stages, the Old Wardens came to Earth, either extraterrestrially or extradimensionally. During this time, <a href="/hostile_beasts/the_never.html">The Never</a>, or what the Old Wardens often referred to as "The Traveler", ran rampantly unchecked across the globe. Over time, the Old Wardens managed to confine the phenomenon of The Never to specific locations magically secluded from the rest of the world.</p>

    <p>The Old Wardens stood watch in these locations as human civilization sprung up around them, and the Wardens began to notice that many of the magical creatures of the world became drawn to these places, perhaps in effort to flee the intrusive advancements of humanity around them. With The Never primarily choosing to feed on magical creatures, the Old Wardens realized these often-helpless beings would need protection.</p>

    <p>By cosmic schedule, or for other reasons no longer known to us, the Old Wardens could not stay in our earthly plane forever, and knew that it would soon be time for them to move on. For this, they began to instruct gifted humans all over the world on their ways: teaching them of the secret locations cloistered away from the rest of the world, the magical creatures and their care, and the dangers of The Never. Much later, these cells of new shepherds became unified under The Hermetic Order of the Verdant Shield, also known as The Greenshields.</p>

    <h2 id="entry_15">Entry #15 Umbral Lethea</h2>

    <p>Within each chapter of the Deep Woods sits a dark place, kept from even the Green Witch, kept from us all. Her Carafalque will sit atop its entrance, a stone for her to one day inhabit; an extra measure to ensure that even in death and the form she takes after, she will continue to dam the waters as an eternal guardian. Within Umbral Lethea, it is said, as no Greenshield is permitted to enter, is a pit lined and pierced with the ultimate sigils and protections of the Old Wardens' mysterious magics. Beyond is <a href="/hostile_beasts/the_never.html">The Never</a>, where it sits crippled, reaching out with its mind and projecting foul extensions of itself on the surface once the sun's gaze fails.</p>

    <h2 id="entry_16">Entry #16</h2>

    <p>Coming Soon</p>

    <h2 id="entry_17">Entry #17 Stirs A Traveler, Restless</h2>

    <p>Below the barrier of the Green Witch Catafalque lies Umbral Lethea, the prison proper of <a href="/hostile_beasts/the_never.html">The Never</a>. Upon to this hellish place I am confronted by the Sable Stele, a large stone tablet with an ancient inscription upon it serving as a final warning to any that might pursue past its vigil. Though the language etched into its black stone, the language of the Old Wardens, is now mostrly lost to us, the ancient texts of Snowdonia provide a translation that remains intact:</p>

    <p>Yarely beware and meddle not<br />
    Behind this ingot stirs a traveler, restless<br />
    A slakeless maw confined<br />
    Its land is Nowhere<br />
    Its name is Never</p>

    <p>If only I could spy The Never, in its stygian intangibility, I could perhaps more accurately describe it... Perhaps in defining it I could glean some insight as how to better quell it. I have come this far... I could be the first to return. It is forbidden, Ffion often reminds me. Yet...</p>
